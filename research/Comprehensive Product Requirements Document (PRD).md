# Comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Microservices Scaffolding Application

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a full-stack scaffolding application that generates microservices-based applications using AWS SAM and Amplify Gen2. The scaffolding application follows the same architecture pattern it generates, providing a consistent development experience. By integrating AI-powered project creation through Claude Code SDK and comprehensive GitHub automation, this platform addresses the complex challenges of modern microservices development while maintaining organizational standards and best practices.

The application targets development teams seeking to accelerate microservices creation while ensuring architectural consistency, security compliance, and operational excellence. Key differentiators include AI-assisted project design, automated GitHub integration, and CQRS pattern implementation across generated applications.

## Problem Statement

### Current Development Challenges

Modern software development faces significant challenges in microservices architecture adoption[1][2]. Organizations struggle with:

**Architectural Inconsistency**: Development teams often create microservices with varying patterns, technologies, and standards, leading to maintenance nightmares and operational complexity[1].

**Time-to-Market Pressure**: Manual microservices setup requires substantial boilerplate code, infrastructure configuration, and integration work, delaying feature delivery[3].

**Knowledge Barriers**: Implementing modern patterns like CQRS, event-driven architectures, and proper security configurations requires specialized expertise that may not be available across all development teams[4][5].

**Scaffolding Complexity**: Traditional scaffolding tools lack intelligence and context awareness, generating generic templates that require extensive customization[6][7].

**Operational Overhead**: Managing multiple microservices repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure components creates significant operational burden[8].

### Market Opportunity

The microservices architecture market continues to grow as organizations seek scalable, maintainable solutions[9]. However, existing scaffolding tools fail to address the full lifecycle of microservices development, from initial creation to ongoing maintenance and evolution.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

**Accelerate Microservices Development**: Reduce time-to-market for new microservices from weeks to hours through intelligent automation and code generation[7].

**Enforce Architectural Consistency**: Ensure all generated microservices follow established patterns including CQRS, event-driven communication, and security best practices[4][5].

**Democratize Advanced Patterns**: Enable developers of varying skill levels to implement sophisticated architectural patterns without deep expertise[1].

**Streamline Operations**: Automate repository management, CI/CD pipeline creation, and infrastructure provisioning to reduce operational overhead[8].

### Key Objectives

- Generate production-ready microservices with 90% code coverage and comprehensive testing
- Achieve sub-5-minute project creation time from initial request to working application
- Maintain 99.9% uptime for the scaffolding application itself
- Support concurrent development of 100+ microservices projects
- Integrate with existing enterprise authentication and authorization systems
