# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Full-Stack Scaffolding Platform

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of an innovative full-stack scaffolding application that leverages AI-assisted development to generate microservices-based applications. The platform itself follows the same architecture it generates for other projects, serving as both a powerful development tool and a reference implementation of best practices.

The scaffolding platform addresses the critical challenge of accelerating enterprise application development while maintaining consistency, quality, and architectural standards. By integrating Claude Code SDK for intelligent project analysis and automated code generation, the platform reduces project initialization time from weeks to minutes while ensuring adherence to CQRS patterns and microservices best practices.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- **70% reduction** in project initialization time through AI-assisted scaffolding
- **Standardized architecture** across all generated applications ensuring consistency
- **Self-documenting design** where the scaffolding tool demonstrates its own patterns
- **Enterprise-ready** with built-in security, scalability, and monitoring capabilities

## Problem Statement

Modern enterprise development teams face significant challenges in starting new microservices-based projects:

1. **Complexity Overhead**: Setting up a microservices architecture with proper CQRS implementation, event-driven communication, and shared infrastructure requires extensive expertise and time investment.

2. **Inconsistent Implementations**: Without standardized scaffolding, different teams implement similar patterns differently, leading to maintenance nightmares and knowledge silos.

3. **Manual Configuration Burden**: Developers spend 20-30% of project initialization time on repetitive configuration tasks including AWS SAM templates, Amplify Gen2 setup, authentication configuration, and CI/CD pipeline creation.

4. **Lack of Best Practices Enforcement**: Teams often miss critical architectural decisions around event-driven communication, data model separation, and proper CQRS implementation.

5. **Limited AI Integration**: Despite 97% of developers using AI tools, most scaffolding solutions lack intelligent project analysis and automated decision-making capabilities.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Accelerate Development Velocity**
   - Reduce project initialization time from days to under 30 minutes
   - Enable developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure setup
   - Achieve first meaningful commit within one hour of project creation

2. **Enforce Architectural Standards**
   - Ensure all generated projects follow CQRS pattern correctly
   - Implement consistent microservices communication patterns
   - Standardize security and authentication approaches

3. **Leverage AI for Intelligent Scaffolding**
   - Use Claude Code SDK to analyze project requirements intelligently
   - Generate contextually appropriate microservices and data models
   - Provide AI-powered recommendations for architectural decisions

### Success Criteria

- **Adoption**: 80% of new projects using the scaffolding platform within 6 months
- **Time Savings**: Average project setup time reduced by 70%
- **Quality**: Generated projects pass 100% of architectural compliance checks
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 40+
