# 🚀 Skafu Implementation Plan - Observability-First MVP

## Executive Summary

Implementation plan for Skafu MVP focusing on the **Observability Domain** with complete infrastructure, security, and monitoring capabilities.

## 📋 Implementation Scope

### ✅ **What We're Building:**
- **Frontend**: Complete React SPA with all planned pages (observability features functional)
- **Backend**: Full AWS serverless infrastructure with observability domain APIs
- **Infrastructure**: Complete AWS SAM templates for observability domain only
- **Security**: Full Cognito authentication, IAM roles, encryption, validation
- **Monitoring**: Complete CloudWatch, X-Ray, structured logging, alerts
- **CI/CD**: Full GitHub Actions pipeline with Git Flow (develop → main)
- **Data Access**: Event sourcing with DynamoDB event store and CQRS pattern (for other domains and error analytics, not for core observability data retrieval)

### 🚧 **What We're Stubbing:**
- **Domains**: Project Management, Template Management, AI Integration, GitHub Integration
- **APIs**: Stub endpoints that return mock data for non-observability features
- **Infrastructure**: Only AWS resources needed for observability domain
